## 1. Project Structure

The project conforms to a modular, scalable architecture separating core presentation, domain data, shared layouts, design tokens, and static brand assets:

## 2. Technology Decisions

| Technology | Selection | Strategic Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Framework** | **Next.js 15 (App Router)** | Static site generation (SSG) produces zero client-side hydration penalty for static marketing pages while offering seamless edge deployment capabilities. |
| **Runtime Language** | **TypeScript 5.8** | Guarantees strict type safety across all domain data, navigation schemas, and component prop contracts. Prevents silent runtime regressions. |
| **Styling Engine** | **Tailwind CSS 3.4** | Utility-first compilation ensures zero CSS bloat in production; all styles compile down to single-digit kilobyte bundles. Strict theme constraints enforce brand discipline. |
| **Font Engine** | **Geist & Geist Mono** | Engineered specifically by Vercel for high-density, legible modern developer interfaces and computational typography. Loaded via `next/font` for zero layout shift (CLS). |
| **Asset Pipeline** | **Native SVG & AVIF/WebP** | Uncompressed lossless vector graphics for all logos and symbols; automated multi-format image optimization for photographic and raster renders. |

## 3. Component Strategy

To prevent brittle monolithic page architectures:

1. **Server Components by Default**:
   All marketing narrative, layout grids, cards, and static links render on the server. Zero client JavaScript is shipped for static display elements.
2. **Client Components Only When Interactive**:
   Client components (`'use client'`) are strictly isolated to interactive elements requiring browser APIs (e.g. mobile drawer toggle, active scroll spy, request form submission).
3. **Atomic Primitives in `src/components/ui/`**:
   Buttons, badges, hairline containers, and chips are built as atomic, reusable primitives with strictly defined variants (Primary, Strategic Accent, Ghost).
4. **Isolated Section Modules in `src/sections/`**:
   Every section of the homepage is encapsulated in its own folder under `src/sections/` with its own isolated interfaces and tests. No single file exceeds 250 lines.

## 4. Design Principles

1. **Anti-AI Trope Mandate**:
   * Strictly no floating robotic hands, glowing neural mesh backgrounds, cartoon mascots, or generic chatbot interfaces.
   * Grounded in the architectural minimalism and computational authority of Apple, Tesla, Stripe, Linear, Vercel, and Anthropic.
2. **Sovereign Contrast Architecture**:
   * Dominant Black + White foundation (`#000000` pitch black, `#050505` canvas void, `#FFFFFF` pure white typography).
   * High contrast readability with 1px hairline dividers (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08)`) instead of heavy artificial shadows.
3. **Disciplined Strategic Accent**:
   * Electric Indigo (`#5B4FFF`) derived from the official Orbion mark is budgeted to `< 7%` of total screen real estate.
   * Reserved strictly for critical state markers, focal badges, and primary interactive trigger states.

---

## 5. Deployment Strategy

The repository is built to be platform-agnostic, supporting standard multi-cloud edge networks:

* **Vercel**: Native zero-configuration detection via Next.js App Router.
* **Netlify**: Automatic adaptation via Next.js runtime plugin with static export support.
* **Render**: Pre-configured standard scripts:
  * Build Command: `npm run build`
  * Start Command: `npm run start`
* **GitHub Actions**: Automated linting (`npm run lint`) and type-checking (`tsc --noEmit`) on every pull request.

---

## 6. Future Expansion Strategy

* **Phase 2 Ready**: Direct plug-and-play integration for Header/Navbar, Footer, and UI primitives.
* **Early Access / Waitlist**: Form endpoints can connect to serverless edge functions or PostgreSQL without altering page markup.
* **Internationalization (i18n)**: App Router structure supports straightforward migration to `[locale]` sub-paths when global markets expand.
* **Documentation & Technical RFCs**: Standalone MDX or Contentlayer pipelines can be layered on top of `src/app/research` without refactoring existing landing components.
